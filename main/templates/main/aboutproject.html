        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our media review platform!</p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a space where users can discover, rate, and review both <strong>books and movies</strong>.<p> 
        <p>Whether you're into fantasy novels, gripping thrillers, or blockbuster films — this is the place for you.</p>
        <p>On top of reviews, we’ve also built a fully functional <strong>marketplace</strong> where users can buy, sell, or trade books and movies. It’s a community-driven hub for media lovers.</p>
        <p>The application supports user accounts, detailed listings, review systems, and secure transactions. It’s designed to be clean and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>This project is developed by a 4-person team of passionate students who share a love for coding, storytelling, and cinema.</p> 
        <p>We’ve combined our skills to create a dynamic, interactive web experience.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!</p>
